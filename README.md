Prototype String functions for jQuery

jQuery is a fantastic javascript library with excellent CSS selector capabilities and DOM manipulation. It's light-weight and really fast. Prototype is an excellent all-purpose library with many great utility features, including string manipulation, enumerable arrays and hashes. I love using jQuery for its speed and simplicity, but I miss Prototype's utilities. Luckily, jQuery is very extensible with its versatile plugin system. $.string is a plugin which aims to provide Prototype's string manipulation functions to jQuery.

$.string requires jQuery 1.2.2 or later. It may work with earlier versions, but only these have been tested. $.string has been tested with the following web browsers:

* Chrome 11+ (probably works with earlier versions)
* Firefox 2.x, 3.x or 4.x
* Internet Explorer 6+
* Opera 9.5
* Safari 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x
